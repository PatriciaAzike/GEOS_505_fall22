# Goals for the semester

1. Sharpen my programming and computing skills to a certain level of competency by the end of the semester.
2. Dare myself by undertaking projects beyond the scope of the class
3. Use the knowledge gained from the class to build a "dashboard" or site or something that accurately predicts smoke transport in Idaho
4. Set aside at least 3 hrs each week to practice what I have learned
